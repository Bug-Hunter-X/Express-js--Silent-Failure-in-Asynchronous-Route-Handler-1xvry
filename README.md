# Express.js Unhandled Asynchronous Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: unhandled errors in asynchronous route handlers.

## The Problem

Asynchronous operations within Express.js routes must be handled properly to prevent the application from silently failing. If an error occurs within an asynchronous function, and it is not caught, the error will not be propagated to the Express.js middleware, and the application might continue to run without indicating the failure.

## The Solution

The solution involves carefully handling errors within the asynchronous function using `.catch()` or `try...catch` blocks and providing appropriate responses to the client, such as sending an error status code (500) or a custom error message.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install`.
4. Run `node bug.js`. You will notice the server starts, but the error is only logged to the console; there is no indication to the client that an error occurred.
5. Run `node bugSolution.js`.  This version demonstrates proper error handling.
